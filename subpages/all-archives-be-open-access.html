            István Rév argues three main points in this article, published in MIT. Firstly, he argues that open
            access isn't a neutral position, neither morally nor politically (Rév). Rév also discusses the instability
            of the historical meanings of people and documents, which means that powerful individuals/groups can rewrite
            them over time. Furthermore, he also suggests that archives and their sources must be trustworthy (Rév).
        </p>

        <p>
            Firstly, Rév suggests that making archives fully open, especially digitally, can be harmful. Information
            taken from public records can weaken research when it is detached from its original context, since the
            background, purpose, and conditions of its creation are often missing or difficult to reconstruct (Rév).
            Rév suggests that public records are not the same as harmless records, and treating them as such can
            ignore privacy rights and context.
        </p>

        <p>
            Rév convincingly shows that open access can cause harm. Still, in this article, he tends to frame openness
            primarily as a risk, rather than as a corrective effort to historical exclusion. The dangers of ignoring how
            restricted archives have traditionally served the privileged, such as state powers, academic elites, and
            Western institutions, mean that limiting access can itself continue the cycle of inequality rather than
            prevent harm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Secondly, Rév states that history can be rewritten by entities that hold specific powers. The power dynamics
            of people and documents constantly shift over time, due to politics, legalities, and cultural significances
            (Rév). What was once a military record can later be treated as medical data (Rév). What was once private can
            become "public interest" (Rév). Open access to documents can freeze them according to current morals and
            potentially enable misuse by bad actors (Rév).
        </p>
        <p>
            In a way, the Bible is a prime example of this. The Bible translates into English, then into countless
            other languages worldwide. Meanings can get lost during translation. All the Bible is, at the end of the
            day, just an open-access document, which can be misinterpreted and where bad actors can cherry-pick
            information to support a specific narrative, like the American Republican Party's narrative that
            homosexuality is a sin. Matthew 22:39 states "Love your neighbour as yourself" (<i>Holy Bible</i>, Mat. 22.39).
            Whereas then Leviticus 18:22 states "Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman;
            that is detestable" (<i>Holy Bible</i>, Lev. 18.22). Left-wing or right-wing political parties can use either
            of these contrasting quotes on the stance of homosexuality, and whether it is a sin or not. Linking back
            to Rév, this demonstrates how when complex, context-dependent material becomes fully open access,
            individuals can selectively extract fragments, strip them of historical and interpretive context,
            and weaponise them to legitimise contemporary political or moral agendas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, Rév argues that archives must operate as trusted institutions rather than neutral repositories of
            data. These institutions' responsibility is not only to preserve documents, but also to maintain their
            contextual integrity and ethical care for individuals named within records; for example, in sensitive
            court proceedings or in one's military records (Rév). When archival materials are made fully and
            indiscriminately open online, documents are detached from the conditions of their creation and from
            the mediated responsibility of researchers. This shift risks transforming archives into sources of
            surveillance, political weaponisation, or personal harm, rather than spaces for careful historical
            inquiry (Rév). For Rév, trust in the archive depends on restraint as much as access, requiring a
            continuous balancing act between the public's right to know and the protection of privacy and context.
