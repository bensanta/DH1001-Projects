    <div class="response">
        <p>My group and I drafted The Internet's Constitution. We created this because it's essential to have an
            internationally recognised standard for how certain parts of the internet should operate, such as social
            media platforms and generative AI tools. We decided to do this in class, then asked a wide range of people
            from different cultures and ages what they think the internet is, and what it should/could be. The survey
            data technically shouldn't be used, as even though it was anonymous and the volunteers gave their informed
            consent, my group should've filled out an SRE. Shawn, however, thankfully, did permit us to use the data,
            with the caveat that we have to comment on it.
        </p>

        <p>During the design process, we had a couple of disagreements about how to structure the document; however,
            we are all happy with the final result. We decided to use text over any other medium, since it's a proposed
            constitution; a legal framework makes more sense in text than in any other medium.
        </p>

        <p>As for the implementation, as always, that's the trickiest part. I hope that something like our Constitution
            becomes an ISO-like standard and a proper framework that technology companies of all shapes and sizes have
            to adhere to. For example, the Constitution would include a ban on social media monopolies, like
            Meta currently has. The Constitution would also add in more safeguards, like the UK's Online Safety Act,
            or Australia's soon-to-be ban on social media for under-16s. However, enforcement like this is tricky,
            as it would imply ID verification, and for that, the ID data is encrypted and stored securely; otherwise,
            data breaches would be even more damaging than they are now.
        </p>
        <p>My personal contribution was writing the introduction for the Google Form, researching current protections,
            such as GDPR and the Online Safety Act. I also expressed my hope that global governments would come
            together to expand our Constitution and put it into practice for the betterment of society.
