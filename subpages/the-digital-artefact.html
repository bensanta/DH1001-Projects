        <h4>We, the people believe,</h4>
        <p>
            The internet is central in every user's life, in how it treats us and how we are protected and how we can
            avail of it. Censorship, privacy, punishment and usage governed by the minority limiting the freedom of the
            internet. Freedom of participation, engagement, and safety. We demand an internet of equality, transparency
            and fair consequence. Where culture thrives with open and fair access to sharing of our experiences and
            knowledge. It is the will of the people that the Internet be transparent, inclusive, and fairly accessible.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Virtues</h3>
        <p>
            We intend to create a shared international standard for digital rights and privacy to challenge and be
            respected by governments and companies alike. This is the future that we dictate and will strive to create,
            one of digital inclusion and fair access. Legitimate oversight of generative AI tools, widespread data
            protections,fair usage terms, and transparency between the agreements and contracts online.
        </p>
        <h3>Imposition</h3>
        <p>
            It is in our interest of virtue, to abide be democratic trust and ethics of society. Responsibility,
            accountability and accessibility are the keystones of a promising plan.
        </p>
        <p>
            While we promote freedom of information on the internet we will promote the constitution to the same
            standards. Encouraging official unions,community spaces and weekly updates. In the spirit of setting
            standards to develop our means all institutions and establishments should follow regulation to allow
            for these registered groups.
        </p>
        <p>
            Democratic responsibility and accountability must be shared and pioneered by an elected representative.
            This ambassador is trusted to fully dedicate themselves to raising awareness within the political and
            societal spheres and taking appropriate cases for violations of the constitution, its beliefs and the
            rights of its people.
        </p>
        <p>
            Such a motion will require the co-operation of the elected governments to self impose and maintain the
            values that society elects them for. It is the collective assignment responsibility to push ourselves to
            take on this endeavor. For the promise of standardised and shared experience online, that thrives on
            community values.
