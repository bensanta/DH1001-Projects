            Before discussing the future potentials of VR, AR, and XR technologies, it's essential to specify which of
            these technologies are. Virtual reality (VR) is a three-dimensional simulated environment, usually achieved
            through technologies such as goggles, headsets, gloves, and/or body suits (Lonwood). Augmented Reality (AR)
            uses "camera-equippad hardware such as smart glasses" to add digital elements into your physical space
            (Hayes). Extended Reality (XR) is an umbrella term for technologies which combine the physical world and
            digital environments, like VR, AR, and Mixed Reality (MR) ("Extended Reality").

        </p>

        <p>
            Mental health professionals can use VR for treatments. For example, if a mental health professional
            suggests that a patient undergo exposure therapy, then VR could be a safe way to do that. A VR environment
            could simulate a tall building, and the patient could attempt to overpower their fear of heights by being
            exposed to virtual danger. As it's a VR environment, it's realistic, but the patient also knows they have
            the right to withdraw whenever they feel like they have to stop. Whereas if the patient were to go to a
            tall building, it may not be as easy to leave the experience, as there are often crowds and other
            unpredictable variables.
        </p>

        <p>
            An AR application could be used for navigation in workspaces, such as warehouses, by workers managing
            inventory. AR tech could work by a customer placing a pickup order, then an employee would receive a
            notification on their AR glasses, similar to what Microsoft's HoloLens aims to be. The glasses would
            use ultra-wideband access points throughout the warehouse to triangulate their location based on signal
            strength. Then, once it's established location, it would visually guide the employee to the item and even
            highlight it on the shelf.

        </p>

        <p>
            These examples represent only a small subset of potential XR applications, and engaging critically with such
            technologies as consumers is essential, as they are generally developed to increase efficiency,
            accessibility, and quality of life rather than to complicate everyday experience.
