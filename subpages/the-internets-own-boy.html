        <p><i>The Internet's Own Boy</i> is such a fascinating movie. It highlights the story of Aaron Swartz, who led the
            charge for open access and digital freedoms online. He accomplished many things, including creating RSS
            (Really Simple Syndication) and Reddit. The film shows him as someone who believed that publicly funded
            knowledge should be available freely. Swartz also believed that access to knowledge shouldn't be a technical
            question but a moral one, driven by global values, such as affordable education. His attempt to make
            paywalled knowledge public from JSTOR, by downloading articles via MIT's access, is framed as a civil
            activity. Unfortunately, the US government chose to make an example of him to discourage others from
            committing piracy, even though JSTOR never actually wanted to press charges.

        <h4>
            Today's control over knowledge
        </h4>
        <p>Technically, there is a monopoly over knowledge today, even if not a monopoly; control is unequally divided
            and not with equity in mind. Governments decide what research they will fund. Academic databases, such as
            JSTOR, decide what research they publish and who can afford to read it. Technology conglomerates, such as
            Google and Meta, shape which information rises to the top and which gets buried. Their algorithms
            personalise content based on location, browsing history, and predicted preferences, enabling political
            messaging to be targeted with incredible precision. For example, someone living in a strongly Republican
            state is more likely to see Republican ads during election season because the platforms optimise ad delivery
            to audiences they think are most receptive. The result is that these companies don't just distribute
            information; they actively influence which knowledge people encounter and how often. Governments may also
            control access through copyright laws and surveillance policies. The film states that, despite the early
            internet's goal of being a decentralised knowledge base, control drifted in a capitalist style towards
            groups with financial or political power. Ordinary users participate in creating knowledge, even by
            publishing their own blogs, but have very little control over who will naturally come across it. While
            trying to grow my photography business, I've realised how difficult it is to understand SEO and actually
            rank well in search results. Visibility isn't about the quality of the work; it's about navigating systems
            designed to favour those who already have reach, resources, or technical expertise.
